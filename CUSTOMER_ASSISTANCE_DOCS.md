### 2. FAQ Section

## Data Structure

### Frontend Form Data

```javascript
{
  sizeGuide: {
    bulletPoints: ["string", "string", ...],
    image: "url_string"
  },
  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "string",
      answer: "string"
    }
  ],
  customerSupportNotes: ["string", "string", ...]
}
```

### Database Schema

```javascript
sizeGuide: {
  bulletPoints: [String], // Max 200 chars each
  image: String // Max 500 chars (URL)
},
faqSection: [{
  question: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 200 },
  answer: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 1000 }
}],
customerSupportNotes: [String] // Max 300 chars each
```

## Validation Rules

### Size Guide

- Bullet points: Optional, max 200 characters each
- Image: Optional, must be valid URL
- Empty bullet points are automatically removed

### FAQ Section

- Questions: Required if answer provided, max 200 characters
- Answers: Required if question provided, max 1000 characters
- Empty Q&A pairs are automatically removed

### Customer Support Notes

- Optional, max 300 characters each
- Empty notes are automatically removed

## Migration from Old System

A migration script is available to convert existing products from the old single-text-field format to the new structured format:

```javascript
// Run the migration script (uncomment the function call)
import migrateCustomerAssistanceData from "@/scripts/migrate-customer-assistance";
migrateCustomerAssistanceData();
```

### Migration Logic:

1. **Size Guide**: Splits old text on common separators (newlines, bullets, dashes)
2. **FAQ Section**: Attempts to parse Q: and A: patterns, falls back to generic FAQ
3. **Support Notes**: Splits old text into individual note entries

## Best Practices

### For Admins:

1. **Size Guide**: Use clear, concise bullet points. Upload high-quality size charts.
2. **FAQs**: Write clear questions that customers actually ask. Provide complete answers.
3. **Support Notes**: Include relevant information that helps support staff assist customers.

### For Developers:

1. Always validate data on both frontend and backend
2. Handle empty/undefined values gracefully
3. Use the cleaning logic in form submission to remove empty entries
4. Test thoroughly with various data combinations

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Form validation prevents submission of incomplete data
- Backend validation ensures data integrity
- Migration script handles edge cases in old data
- Graceful fallbacks for missing or malformed data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- Rich text editor for FAQ answers
- Image gallery for size guides
- Templated support notes
- Multi-language support for international customers
- Analytics on FAQ usage
