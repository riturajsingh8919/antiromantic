# Wishlist Authentication Fix - Implementation Guide

## Problem Fixed

The wishlist was previously stored only in localStorage, which meant:

- Wishlist items persisted across user sessions
- Different users on the same browser would see each other's wishlist items
- Wishlist data wasn't tied to user accounts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update

- Added `wishlist` field to User model (`src/models/UserModel.js`)
- Wishlist stores product references with timestamps
- Each wishlist item contains productId and addedAt timestamp

### 2. API Endpoints Created

- `GET /api/wishlist` - Fetch user's wishlist
- `POST /api/wishlist` - Add item to wishlist
- `DELETE /api/wishlist?productId=<id>` - Remove specific item
- `DELETE /api/wishlist/clear` - Clear entire wishlist

### 3. WishlistContext Updates

- Integrated with authentication system using `useAuth`
- Wishlist now loads from database when user is authenticated
- Automatic migration of existing localStorage data to database
- Wishlist clears when user logs out
- All operations require authentication

### 4. AuthContext Updates

- Logout function now clears localStorage data (wishlist, cart, coupons)
- Ensures clean state when users switch accounts

## Key Features

### Authentication Integration

```javascript
// Only authenticated users can manage wishlist
if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
  toast.error("Please login to add items to wishlist");
  return;
}
```

### Automatic Migration

- When a user logs in, any existing localStorage wishlist data is automatically migrated to their account
- localStorage is cleared after successful migration

### User-Specific Storage

- Each user's wishlist is stored in their MongoDB document
- Complete isolation between different user accounts
- Persistent across devices when same user logs in

### Clean Logout

- All user-specific localStorage data is cleared on logout
- Prevents data bleeding between user sessions

## API Response Format

### Get Wishlist Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "wishlist": [
    {
      "_id": "productId",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 1000,
      "comparePrice": 1200,
      "images": ["image1.jpg"],
      "slug": "product-slug",
      "category": "men",
      "colorName": "Black",
      "sizeStock": [...],
      "totalStock": 10,
      "isFeatured": true,
      "addedAt": "2023-10-03T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add to Wishlist Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Item added to wishlist",
  "product": {
    /* product details */
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

- Authentication errors return 401 status
- Product not found returns 404 status
- Duplicate items return 400 status with appropriate message
- All errors show user-friendly toast messages

## Components Updated

- `WishlistContext.jsx` - Complete rewrite to use database
- `AuthContext.jsx` - Added localStorage cleanup on logout
- `UserModel.js` - Added wishlist schema field

## Migration Strategy

1. Existing localStorage wishlist data is automatically migrated when users log in
2. No manual migration required
3. Users will see their existing wishlist items after first login
4. Old localStorage data is cleaned up after migration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can add items to wishlist when logged in
- [ ] Anonymous users get prompt to login
- [ ] Wishlist persists across browser sessions for logged-in users
- [ ] Wishlist clears when user logs out
- [ ] Different users see different wishlist items
- [ ] Existing localStorage data migrates correctly
- [ ] API endpoints return proper error messages
- [ ] All wishlist operations show appropriate toast messages

## Future Enhancements

- Similar authentication-based approach for cart items
- Wishlist sync across multiple devices
- Wishlist sharing functionality
- Wishlist item notifications (price drops, stock alerts)
